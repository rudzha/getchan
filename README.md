# getchan
Fourchan thread downloader. Just a little Python experiment, that serves two purposes:
1. It lets me try out FP ideas in Python
2. It lets me grab YLYL threads before they 404 in case I come in late or I pass out

# Requirements
* Python 3.5
* requests

# Usage
1. python main.py [link to the thread]
2. Wait for the thread to 404
3. Check out the freshly created thread directory
